# DQproject5

Covid-19 was a game changer in many fields including business, tech, science etc. The currency market is one area that has also been affected.

In this project we analyse how the EUR-US currency exchange was affected by the pandemic and compare the same over its performance over five years i.e. between 2016-2021.

The learning goal of this project was to get a more in depth understanding of data visualization including the concept of story telling with the same. Accordingly this project was more focussed on trying to tell the story of how the EUR-US exchange rate changed over the year. Analysis, therefore in this project is comparatively less.
